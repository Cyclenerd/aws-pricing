## Fork the Repository 🍴

Start by forking the repository. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the
upper right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository
in your GitHub account.

## Clone Your Fork 📥

Clone your newly created fork of the repository to your local machine with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-pricing.git
```

## Create a New Branch 🌿

Create a new branch for the specific issue or feature you are working on.
Use a descriptive branch name:

```bash
git checkout -b "feature-or-issue-name"
```

## Submitting Changes 🚀
Make your desired changes to the codebase.

Stage your changes using the following command:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit."
```

## Create a Pull Request 🌟

Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click on the "New Pull Request" button.
This will open a new pull request to the original repository.

## Coding Style 📝

Start reading the code, and you'll get the hang of it. It is optimized for readability:

- Shell variables must be uppercase and should begin with `MY_`.
- Functions must be lowercase.
- Check your shell scripts with ShellCheck before submitting.
- Please use tabs to indent.

## Keep It Simple 👍

Simplicity is key. When making changes, aim for clean, easy-to-understand code that benefits all users.

Thank you for your contribution! ❤️
