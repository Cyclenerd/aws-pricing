## üñäÔ∏è Add, edit or change instance type information

This project values transparency and collaboration.
For EC2 instance type information, we rely on the official Amazon EC2 API (`describe-instance-types`), ensuring data accuracy and updates.
Additional data resides in well-defined SQL files, making it easily understandable and modifiable.

Dive into the [build](./build/) folder to see how the data is retrieved, processed, and integrated.
Feel free to explore and contribute!
